# Hello there! I'm [Daine](https://daine.dev).

And I write code.

I've been writing code for more than 15(!) years, and I have a BS in math and computer science. I've worked in the tech industry as both a quality assurance engineer and a database engineer and I read standards documenation in my spare time. So you might say I kinda dig code ;)

I accept forum RP coding commissions through a project I call [Magrathea](https://magrathea.guide).
